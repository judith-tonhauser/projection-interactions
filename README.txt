This repository contains the two experiments, materials, and analysis scripts reported on in Judith Degen & Judith Tonhauser "Projection inferences: On the relation between prior beliefs, at-issueness, and lexical meaning".

The repository has the following folders:

*experiments: The materials and code to run Exp 1 and Exp 2.

*output: Talk slides and papers based on the experiments

*results: R code to analyze the data of Exp 1 and Exp 2. This folder also contains the full model outputs under /models/full-model-outputs. The models (.rds) were not pushed to the repository as they are too big. Please contact Judith Tonhauser if you would like access to the models.
