This repository contains the two experiments, materials, and analysis scripts reported on in Judith Degen & Judith Tonhauser "Projection inferences: On the relation between prior beliefs, at-issueness, and lexical meaning".

The repository has the following folders:

*experiments: The materials and code to run Exp 1 and Exp 2. 

*output: Talk slides and papers based on the experiments (removed for review)

*results: R code to analyze the data of Exp 1 and Exp 2. The data is under /data, the figures included in the paper are in /graphs, and the analyses reported in the paper are under /rscripts/analysis.R. 

This folder also contains the full model outputs under /models/full-model-outputs. The models themselves (.rds files) were not pushed to the repository as they are too big. Please contact Judith Tonhauser if you would like access to the models.

The folder /results/exp1/rscripts also includes a comparison of the beta models to ZOIB models (ZOIB-comparison) as well as auxiliary analyses were individual projection ratings are predicted from mean at-issueness and (mean / individual-level) prior ratings. These were not reported in the paper.
